It's 3am and your exhausted. You're dying to get to bed, but you have to do a final check of your paper. You need an A in this class and it has to be perfect.

You'll be coding your solution in both `css/style.css` and `index.html`.

## Get To Work

**1.** Fill in the blanks in `index.html`: replace your name, class, date, and paper title with your information.

**2.** Fanci-fy the font! Let's change the font for the entire paper. Code your solution in `css/style.css`

**3.** Let's make the title a different color. Code your solution in `css/style.css`.

**4.** What about adding a diagram image? We've got a diagram `triangle-diagram.jpg` saved in the images directory. Go ahead and add this image to the paper.

### Bonus
* Try to see if you can center the diagram.

* See if you can put a border around the image. You chose the color, width and style!

* What about a border around the header in the top right corner. Give that a try!
